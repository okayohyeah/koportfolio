      <h2>SD Challenge</h2>
      <p>For our group project we built this React app, which welcomes users to sign up and 
      have fun exploring San Diego through a curated <i>Challenges List</i>. After chosing a
      challenge and the user gets to the location, they complete the challenge by clicking 
      the Complete button. Their location is verified through geolocation and marker is placed
      on their map. Each challenge awards points upon completion. Their total score will be 
      displayed on their user profile as well as the Leaderboard.</p>
      <p><strong>Stack: React, Node, Express, Sequelize, PostgresSQL</p>
