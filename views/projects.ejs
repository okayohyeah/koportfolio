							<!-- SD Challenge info-->
				      <p>For our group project, <span class='yellow_text'>The San Diego Challenge</span>, we built a React app, which welcomes users to sign up and have fun exploring San Diego through a curated <span class='ltyellow_text'>Challenges List</span>. After chosing a challenge and the user gets to the location, they complete the challenge by clicking the <span class='ltyellow_text'>Complete</span> button. Their location is verified through geolocation and a marker is placed
				      on their map. Each challenge awards points upon completion. Their total score will be displayed on their user profile as well as the <span class='ltyellow_text'>Leaderboard</span>.</p>
				      <p><span class='yellow_text'>Built with:</span> 
				      <br>React, Node, Express, Sequelize, PostgresSQL</p>
